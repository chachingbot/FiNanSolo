Should I apply for BTO?
* should/bto

< Are you married?
* prompt/marital_status

No
* decline

< Since you are single you can apply for either a HDB by yourself or an Condominium with other singles. If you don't see yourself moving into a new house for the next couple of years, applying for BTO will be a good idea since it offers you location and timing flexibility.
