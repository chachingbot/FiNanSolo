How do I make a budget?
* how/budgeting

< What is your monthly [income](income), roughly?
* prompt/income

My monthly income is roughly [5000](income).
* user/income

< Alright, lets do this. First set aside the amount of money you need to spend on expenses out of your control, like bills, insurance premiums etc. Next set aside 10%-20% aside for your savings, which would be somewhere between [500](lower_income) and [1000](upper_income) in your case. The remaining money is your discretionary spending fund, which you can use for anything.
