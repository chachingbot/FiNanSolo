How do I budget my monthly income?
* how/budgeting

< What is your monthly [income](income), roughly?
* prompt/income

I'd rather not say.
* user/income_notgiven

< Okay no worries. First set aside the amount of money you need to spend on expenses out of your control, like bills, insurance premiums etc. Next set aside 10%-20% aside for your savings. The remaining money is your discretionary spending fund, which you can use for anything.
